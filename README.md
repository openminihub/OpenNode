###Description
The OpenNode is light and simple library for Arduino that handles wireless communication protocol between controller and nodes with attached sensors/actuators.<br/>
Communication between nodes are serialized using [MySensors.org Serial API v2.0](https://www.mysensors.org/download/serial_api_20) and is compatible with 20+ [controllers](https://www.mysensors.org/controller). Wireless part is implemented using RFM69 library by <a href="https://github.com/LowPowerLab">Felix Rusu</a> (LowPowerLab).
