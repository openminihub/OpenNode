OpenNode

The OpenNode library adds a new layer on top of the RFM69 library by <a href="https://github.com/LowPowerLab">Felix Rusu</a> (LowPowerLab).
It handles radio network and other node functionallity to make code as easy possible.
Node comunication uses MySensors.org [Serial API v2.0](https://www.mysensors.org/download/serial_api_20) and must be compatible with [controllers](https://www.mysensors.org/controller)
